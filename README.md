Automated Oracle Builds

Project forked from the excellent https://github.com/oraclebase/vagrant 

At the moment, this project merely installs 18c SIHA in a virtual-box environment. You are likely better off using Tim's resources and documentation above. Over time this project will diverge somewhat to include other platforms and automation tools.
